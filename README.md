## My Process

### Built With

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

### What I Learned

- Parsing header requests such as language, user software, IP address.

### Continued Development

I will be focussing more on the basic level JavaScript and its various functions, because this project really taught how the basic and fundamental functions can help.
